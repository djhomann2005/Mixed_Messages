Mixed Messages Codecademy Project
=================================

## Description
This program outputs a random combination of tomorrow's weather forecast, and inspirational saying, and a Powerball lottery number. When the user clicks the 'Generate' button, it will select or produce one of each of these three parts, put them together, and display the messgage.

## Features
1. **Weather Forecast Generator:** Generates a forecast by picking a temperature between 10 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a weather condition chosen from an array of possible weather conditions (thunderstorms, rain, cloudy, partly cloudy, sunny), and a wind speed between 0 and 25 mph.
2. **Inspirational Message:** Chosen from an array of inspirational messages.
3. **Powerball Number Generator:** Generates a random Powerball number following the rules of Powerball drawings: Pick 5 white balls from numbers between 1 & 69 inclusive (once a number is picked, it cannot be picked again) and a Powerball from numbers between 1 and 26 inclusive.

## How to Use
When the user clicks the 'Generate' button, the message is generated and displayed on the webpage. No other user input is required.
